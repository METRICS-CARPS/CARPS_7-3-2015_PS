# Target Outcomes
## Article ID: 7-3-2015 PS

For this article you should focus on the findings reported in the results section of Experiment 1.

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> Performance on switch trials, relative to repeat trials,
incurred a switch cost that was evident in longer RTs (836
vs. 689 ms) and lower accuracy rates (79% vs. 92%). If
participants were able to learn the predictive value of the
cue that preceded only switch trials and could instantiate
relevant anticipatory control in response to it, the performance
on switch trials preceded by this cue would be
better than on switch trials preceded by the nonpredictive
cue. This was indeed the case (mean RTâ€”predictive
cue: 819 ms; nonpredictive cue: 871 ms; mean difference
= 52 ms, 95% confidence interval, or CI = [19.5,
84.4]), two-tailed paired t(20) = 3.34, p < .01. However,
error rates did not differ across these two groups of switch trials (predictive cue: 78.9%; nonpredictive cue: 78.8%), p = .8.
